# Learn Rust

Learn rust with simple examples.

## Requirement

- [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)
    `Rust` is the main source code repository for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/). It contains the compiler, standard library, and documentation. Read [Installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch01-01-installation.html) from [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html).
- [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo)
    `Cargo` is distributed by default with Rust, so if you've got rustc installed locally you probably also have cargo installed locally.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rjoydip/learn-rust.git
cd learn-rust
npm start
```
